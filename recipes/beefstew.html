    <h3>Beef, Carrot, and Potato Stew</h3>
    <p><strong>Beef Stew</strong> is a classic dinner and meal that is believed to have originated in the <em>18 century</em>. This meal was not only made at the time for its simplicity, but for its flavorful and mouth watering taste as well. Even among other dishes <strong>Beef Stew</strong> has remained a staple dinner for many households in America since its a easy to make meal that feeds many while keeping the cost low.</p>

    <p>While the <em>"main"</em> recipe for <strong>Beef Stew</strong> may only be beef, carrots, and potatoes. Many will include onion, peas, mushrooms, and even celery to add a personal touch or a flavor that person enjoys. The recipe below is what I personly enjoy in my <strong>Beef Stew</strong>.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong>If your Beef stew is watered down, add more flour. If its too lumpy and solid, add more water or beef broth.</p>
